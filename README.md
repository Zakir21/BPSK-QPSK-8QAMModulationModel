This is a simple model of signal transmission with BPSK, QPSK & 8QAM modulation.

There is:
a modulator for every modulation,
a channel which creates interferences and disruptions
and a demodulator.
We also calculate BER (Bit Error Rate) after transmission and creates a 3D plot how BER is changing with diffrent disruptions.

The code is low quality and comments (if they exists) are in Polish.
